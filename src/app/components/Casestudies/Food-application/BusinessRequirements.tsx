If the customer has not registered earlier, they can sign up by providing their Name, Phone, Email, and Password.

An OTP verification will be done on their phone before they can start using the application.

For login, the customer just needs to provide their phone number and password.

Once inside the application, the customer enters the delivery location by moving the map marker or turning on GPS to obtain the current location. The app then shows all Restaurants within 10km of the selected delivery location.

Serviceable areas are identified as areas where delivery agents are available, or where the Restaurant offers delivery. Otherwise, the area will be marked as not serviceable.

Customers also have the option to browse category-based catalogs of food items from Restaurants near their location.
The categories are: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks.

The customer places an order but is restricted to ordering from a single Restaurant only (i.e., no mixing items from multiple Restaurants). At checkout, they can choose either pickup or delivery.

1. If the customer chooses pickup:
Selects the pickup option.
Pays for the order.
Receives the Restaurant address and can navigate via Google Maps.
Goes to the Restaurant and picks up the order.
The Restaurant owner marks the order as complete.
The customer receives a receipt acknowledgment confirmation.`}

1. When Delivery Personnel is Available:
The customer will get notified that the food will be delivered within an hour (hardcoded estimate).
The customer makes the payment online to confirm the order for delivery.
The food gets delivered to the customer and the entire transaction is complete.
Users may have to wait up to 1 minute to get the delivery confirmation notification as the system queries available delivery agents.

2. When Delivery Personnel is Not Available or Declines Delivery:
The customer will be notified that no delivery agents are available.
The user then has the option to either pick up the order by himself or cancel the order and return to the home screen of the application.
The customer can cancel the order until the food has been dispatched from the Restaurant. Once dispatched, cancellation is not allowed.
On cancellation, the customer will get a refund. Refunds are handled manually by the Admin.
After 30 minutes of pickup or delivery, the customer is gently notified to leave a rating for the food. If the order was delivered, they are also prompted to rate the delivery agent.`}

- 4★ → +0.5%
- 3★ → No change
- 2★ → -0.5%
- 1★ → -1%

Additional feedback options:

          heading="Restaurant Owner Use Case"
          content={`-The Restaurant Owner signs into the Android application. Existing Customers or Delivery Agents can also use this application according to their requirements.

1. If registering for the first time:
The Restaurant Owner selects the Register screen.
They enter their Name, Mobile Number, Email ID, and Aadhaar Number for verification.
The system authenticates the Aadhaar Number and verifies the Mobile Number via OTP.
Upon successful OTP verification, the Restaurant Owner can log in using their Mobile Number and Password.
They are then redirected to the profile setup screen.

2. Profile Setup:
The Restaurant Owner provides Restaurant Name, Restaurant Image, Geo-location/Address, and Phone Number, then clicks Submit.
They can set up their menu list daily by selecting food items pre-populated by the Admin.
If a required menu item is not available, they can request the Admin to add it.
The Restaurant Owner specifies the quantity of each menu item and sets an expiry period (1 to 12 hours).
Menu quantities automatically decrease as orders are received.
Menu items and quantities can be updated anytime.

3. Orders:
The Restaurant Owner gets an alert when an order is received.
The order list includes: Order ID, Order Date, Time, Customer Name, Mobile Number, Delivery Address, Pin Location, Ordered Items, and Delivery/Pickup preference.
Commercial Restaurants will be listed with a special tag, but functionality remains the same.
Restaurant Owners can also provide discounts on menu items.

-Scenarios:

1. If Delivery is Requested by the Customer:
   -Option A: The Restaurant Owner accepts the delivery request.
   They must accept within 15 seconds; otherwise, it passes to the nearest Delivery Agent (who also has 15 seconds to accept). This process repeats for 1 minute.
   If no one accepts, the customer is notified: “Delivery agents are not available. Please pick up the order or cancel.”
   If the Restaurant Owner accepts delivery, they receive an OTP which must be entered into the Delivery Agent’s app.
   Once the Delivery Agent accepts, the customer sees: “Your order got confirmed, please proceed to pay.”  
     The Delivery Agent sees: “Please await payment confirmation.”
    After payment, both the Restaurant Owner and Delivery Agent receive an OTP.  
     The Delivery Agent collects this OTP at pickup, enters it, and the order status updates to “Order Dispatched.”

   -Option B: The Restaurant Owner is not interested in delivery.  
   The order is passed directly to the nearest Delivery Agent, following the same process described above.

2. If Pickup is Selected by the Customer:
After payment, the Restaurant Owner marks the order as ready for pickup.
When the customer collects the order, the Restaurant Owner updates the status as “Completed.”
The customer receives an acknowledgement: “Order has been delivered.”

Notes:
- The Delivery Agent application is standalone for processing all delivery requests.
- Customers, Restaurant Owners, and Independent Delivery Agents can all register and use the application.`}

          content={`-Scenario 1: Using the Delivery Application as a Restaurant Owner
The Restaurant Owner can log in/register with the same credentials as the main app or use separate credentials.
Inside the app, the Restaurant Owner must select “Exclusive Mode.” In this mode, they are not considered for delivery requests from other Restaurants. Instead, they handle deliveries for their own Restaurant.
If signed up for delivery, the Restaurant Owner must accept delivery requests within 15 seconds.

-If Accepted within 15 Seconds:
The Restaurant Owner enters the unique ID (generated in the Restaurant application) into the delivery application before dispatch.
The order status changes from “Processing” to “Left for Delivery.”
Once the delivery is completed, the order is marked as “Complete.”
The customer receives an order delivered acknowledgement.

-If Rejected or Not Accepted within 15 Seconds:
The system searches for the next available Delivery Agent.
This process continues until 1 minute has passed or a Delivery Agent accepts.

---

-Scenario 2: Using the Application as an Independent Delivery Agent
A new Delivery Agent must register by providing Name, Email, Phone, Password, and Aadhaar Number.
Phone and Aadhaar verification is required.
Delivery Agents can log in using their Phone and Password.

-Inside the application:
Agents can toggle between “Accepting Deliveries” mode or “Not Accepting Deliveries” mode.
If available, the agent is notified of incoming order requests.

-If a Delivery Agent Accepts the Order:
They wait for a notification confirming that the customer has paid.
They go to the Restaurant, collect the unique ID from the Restaurant Owner, and enter it into the app.
The order status changes from “Processing” to “Left for Delivery.”
After reaching the customer’s location, they mark the delivery as “Complete” and close the transaction.

-If No Agents Accept:
The system continues searching for the next delivery agent.
If no one accepts within 1 minute, the customer is notified to either pick up the order themselves or cancel it.

-Order Cancellations:
If a customer cancels the order before dispatch, the Delivery Agent is notified and does not need to proceed with the delivery.`}
